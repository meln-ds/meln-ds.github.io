From the fundamental understanding of how platforms are constructed to monetization, metrics, openness, as well as the regulatory framework, the book is truly a great source of knowledge about today’s platform businesses.</p><h2 id="-impressions">🎨 Impressions</h2><p>I can tell that the authors are very knowledgeable in this field. They possess deep insights into the nuts and bolts of platforms, and the examples in the book covered a good variety of platforms (instead of just focusing on a few like Google or Facebook). I took lots of notes, which means I really want to remember the things I have read.</p><p>Fun fact: This book was mentioned in a podcast series call Viet Innovators (by Vietcetera), and in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHsHTOOHx7I&amp;ab_channel=Vietcetera">Kelly Tran</a> (CTO of Pizza 4P). You would not expect the CTO of a pizza company to be into platforms - think again.</p><h2 id="-who-should-read-it">🤓 Who Should Read It?</h2><p>Anyone who has an interest in platform business, or are looking to create a platform business him/herself.</p><h2 id="️-how-the-book-changed-me">☘️ How the Book Changed Me</h2><p>The book gave me knowledge, and knowledge is power! 😁</p><h2 id="️-my-top-3-quotes">✍️ My Top 3 Quotes</h2><p>No top 3 quotes this time. Refer to my summary and notes section.</p><h2 id="-summary--notes">📒 Summary + Notes</h2><ul><li>The platform purpose: to <strong>consummate matches among users and facilitate the exchange of goods, services, or social currency, thereby enabling value creation for all participants.</strong><li>How does platform business beat traditional pipeline business? (pipeline: linear value creation chain starting with design → manufacture → sell → purchase)<ul><li><em>Platform business scales much faster by eliminating gatekeepers:</em> take the example of a book that has to go through the rigorous selection process by editors (gatekeepers) in the hope that the book would be well-received, Kindle allows anyone to publish and let the audience decide the popularity for themselves.<li><em>Platform business unlocks new sources of value creation and supply:</em> pipeline business can do so too but at a much slower pace. For example, it takes a big investment to build a new hotel, whereas it costs Airbnb little to make their platform available in a new country ⇒ no need to deploy capital and manage physical assets.<li><em>Platform business uses data-based tools to create community feedback loops:</em> related to the 1st point above, platform businesses do not need gatekeepers to judge the quality of the products. Instead, the audience feedback creates signals for the value of the products (think Youtube views, Airbnb reviews, etc).<li><em>Platform business inverts the firm:</em> focus shifts to external activities, manage external stakeholders and external resources. Shift from ecosystem governance more than product optimization.</ul></ul><h3 id="network-effects">Network Effects</h3><ul><li>Network Effects: the impact that the number of users of a platform has on the value created for each user.<li>Demand economies of scales:<ul><li>Traditional monopolies rely on supply economies of scale, cutting the cost of producing one unit of product.<li>21st century monopolies are created by demand economies of scale, driven by “efficiencies in social networks, demand aggregation, app development, and others.” ⇒ leverage network effects.</ul><li>Two-sided network effects: as with the case of Uber when two sides are involved, riders attract drivers and vice versa. Or similarly Google Store, or Upwork.<li>Network effect is different from price or brand effects, both of which are effective at certain stages, but not sustainable. It is also not virality, which may kickstart the network effect but is not the effect itself. Network effect creates a longlasting network of users (<em>lock-in</em>).<li>The key factor is enabling the platform: <strong>frictionless entry</strong> - the ability for users to quickly and easily join a platform and begin participating in the value creation process.<li>The key to minimizing negative network effects is quality curation, which increases the chance of a happy match between producer and consumer.</ul><h3 id="architecture---principles-for-designing-a-successful-platform">Architecture - Principles for Designing a Successful Platform</h3><ul><li>In every platform, 3 things are exchanged:<ul><li>information: there is exchange of information even if the platform is not built to do so, eg Uber exchanges information about driver availability.<li>goods or service: each item exchanged among platform users can be referred to as a value unit.<li>currency: not necessarily money, it can be attention, fame, influence, reputation, etc.</ul><li>The Core interaction: the single most important form of activity that takes place on a platform - the exchange of values that attract most users to the platform in the first place. 3 components:<ul><li>The Participants:<ul><li>2 fundamental participants: producers and consumers. The roles are not restrictive in a sense that one can only assume one role. A well-designed platform allows easy movement from role to role (eg. in Airbnb, you can both be a host and a guest).</ul><li>The Value Unit: see above<li>The Filter: an algorithmic tool used by the platform to enable the exchange of appropriate value units between users. A well-designed filter ensures that platform users receive only value units that are relevant and valuable to them (eg. a search query is a filter)</ul><li>Three key functions: pull. facilitate, and match<ul><li>pull the producers and consumers to the platform<li>facilitate interactions by providing tools and rules encouraging value exchange<li>match producers and consumers effectively by using information about each to connect them in ways they will find mutually rewarding.</ul><li>The core interaction itself doesn’t have to be the only kind of interaction. Platforms can enhance by layering new interactions on top of the core interaction eg when LinkedIn starts introducing posts, or allowing recruiters to target candidates.<li>”..the fundamental architecture behind all platforms is essentially the same: namely, the system is partitioned into a set of “core” components with low variety and a complementary set of “peripheral” components with high variety. “ ⇒ the importance of modularity.<li>Platform designers should always leave room for serendipitous discoveries, as uses often lead the way to where the design should evolve. Close monitoring of user behavior on the platform is crucial ⇒ sometimes the best design is anti-design.</ul><h3 id="disruption---how-platforms-conquer-and-transform-traditional-industries">Disruption - How Platforms Conquer and Transform Traditional Industries</h3><ul><li>as self-serve systems, platforms grow and conquer markets when they minimize the barriers to usage for their users. key: constantly remove entry hurdles to tap new source of supply.<li>platforms reconfigure value consumption by enabling new forms of consumer behavior.<li>platforms reconfigure quality control through community-driven curation: can be hard at the start when a new source of supply is added, but over time, the quality control mechanism will kick in, removing the need for curation resources (the community takes care of the job). note though, it is important to get the quality control mechanism right ⇒ gradually phase out manual curation in favor of automated curation mechanisms based on socially driven feedback loops.<li>Structural impacts of platform disruption:<ul><li>De-linking assets from value<ul><li>for B2B business especially. use case: create a market to use hospital MRI machines where value is the time-slice usage of these machines, thereby upping utilization rate from 40-50% to 70-90%.</ul><li>Re-intermediation: instead of deintermediation where the middlemen is eliminated, platforms have re-intermediated markets, introducing new kinds of middlemen rather than simply eliminating layers of market participants.<ul><li>replace non-scalable and inefficient agent intermediaries with online, often automated tools and systems<ul><li>use algorithms and social feedback ⇒ scale quickly<li>gather data over time and use it to make the system more intelligent</ul></ul><li>Market aggregation</ul></ul><h3 id="launch">Launch</h3><ul><li>The chicken-or-egg problem: When trying to build a two-sided market in which both sides are equally essential, which comes first? And how do you attract one without the other?<li>Launch strategy for platform A may not work for platform B. In fact, platforms that are direct competitors may need to adopt different launch strategies in order to strategically position themselves in the market. For example, Vimeo and Youtube have the same basic value unit, but Vimeo focuses on video hosting infra (value proposition to producers) while Youtube focuses on video search and video feed (value proposition to consumers).<li>8 strategies for beating the chicken-or-egg dilemma:<ul><li>Build a platform business on the foundation of an existing pipeline or product business<ul><li>Follow-the-rabbit: use a non-platform demonstration project to model success, thereby attracting both users and producers to a new platform erected on your project’s proven infra. Eg: Amazon started with a pipeline business, then launched Amazon Marketplace, or Intel partnered with NTT to demonstrate that a market for wireless tech.</ul><li>Build a platform from scratch: stage value creation → design platform to attract one set of users → simultaneous onboarding<ul><li>Piggyback: connect with an existing user base from a different platform and stage the creation of value units in order to recruit those users to participate in your platform. Eg: Paypal piggybacked on eBay’s online auction platform, or Youtube rode on Myspace’s growth by providing video tools to Myspace members.<li>Seeding: create value units that will be relevant to at least one set of potential users. When these users are attracted to the platform, other sets of users who want to engage in interactions with them will follow. In many cases, the platform company acts as the first producer. Eg:<ul><li>Google offered 5mil for developers who came up with the best Android apps (expensive strategy)<li>Value units borrowed from another source rather than created by the platform developer. Adobe launched the PDF reading tool in part by arranging to make all federal gov tax forms available online, leading to many adopting Adobe as the platform of choice for other things.<li>Paypal created bots to make purchases on eBay, or Quora editors would create the questions and then answer them themselves.</ul><li>Marquee: Provide incentives to attract members of a key user set onto your platform. Eg: Paypal give cash incentives for every new user and every referral<li>Single-sided: Create a business around products or services that benefit a single set of users; later, convert the business into a platform business by attracting a second set of users who want to engage in interactions with the first set. Eg: OpenTable (restaurant reservation system) started by distributing booking management software to restaurants. Once there are enough restaurants onboard, they then built out the consumer side, allowing them to start booking tables and OpenTable to then collect lead generation fee.<li>Big-bang adoption: Use one or more traditional push marketing strategies to attract a high volume of interest to your platform, triggering a simultaneous on-boarding effect. This strategy needs an appropriate event that could trigger publicity to a massive relevant audience, which isn’t always readily available.<li>Micromarket: Start by targeting a tiny market that comprises members who are already engaging in interactions. Eg: Facebook starts by limiting the platform to just Harvard University. Note: Geography focus isn’t the only way to define a micromarket.</ul></ul><li>Viral growth: user-to-user launch mechanism: 4 elements<ul><li>The sender: not the same as word-of-mouth. Users spread self-created value units to get social feedback, which in turn will bring them some sort of fulfilment (fun, fame, fortune) → well-designed platforms create natural incentives for users to share.<li>The value unit: not all value units are spreadable, so designing spreadable value units is a crucial step towards virality, unless if it is impossible to do so due to eg confidentiality.<li>The external network: many platforms grow on top of other networks (piggyback strategy at play here)<li>The recipient: the recipient will respond to the value unit received if it is relevant, interesting, or otherwise valuable to them. Sometimes a platform can nudge users in directions that will make seeds more attractive eg Instagram provides photo editing tools.</ul></ul><h3 id="monetization">Monetization</h3><ul><li>Monetize platform by charging for the value that the platform creates. 4 categories:<ul><li>For consumers: access to value created on the platform (eg video viewers on Youtube videos)<li>For producers or 3rd party providers: Access to a community or market (eg Airbnb hosts have access to travelers)<li>For both consumers and producers: Access to tools and services that facilitate interaction<li>For both consumers and producers: Access to curation mechanisms that enhance the quality of interactions</ul></ul><p>→ Smart monetization strategy begins by considering all 4 forms of value, then determines which sources of excess value can be exploited by the platform <em>without inhibiting the continued growth of network effect.</em></p><ul><li>Ways to monetize:<ul><li>Charge a txn fee:<ul><li>Buyer/seller are only charged when an actual txn occurs → not discouraged from joining the platform<li>Challenge: capture all the interactions <strong>on the platform</strong> so that buyer/seller would not take the interactions offline in order to avoid paying a fee<li>Workarounds:<ul><li>Provide all the information a consumer needs to make an interaction decision wo connecting the consumer directly with the producer<li>Provide rating mechanism and other social metrics that indicate the reliability of a service provider, making direct contact less necessary.<li>Offers more tools and services that mitigate risks and facilitate interactions</ul></ul><li>Charge for access:<ul><li>Charge producers for access to a community of users who have joined the platform <strong>not</strong> in order to interact with producers but for other unrelated reasons, eg Linkedin allows recruiters to present job oppys to its members and offers companies the ability to compare and target professionals.</ul><li>Charge for enhanced access:<ul><li>Charge producers fees for better targeted messages, more attractive presentations, or interactions with particular valuable users.<li>Charge users for lowering barriers that otherwise exist between users eg Tinder plus<li>Note:<ul><li>Ensure that consumers can easily distinguish between content that has been elevated and content whose high ranking or dominance is organic.<li>Ensure that users do not feel like their access is being restricted.<li>Ensure that curation principles are applied rigorously to content from producers who pay for enhanced access → maintain relevancy</ul></ul><li>Charge for enhanced curation (eg Sittercity, Skillshare)</ul><li>Whom should you charge?<ul><li>Charge all users: OK, but be careful<li>Charge one side while subsidizing another<li>Charge most users full price while subsidizing stars<li>Charge some users full price while subsidizing users who are price sensitive</ul><li>From free to fee:<ul><li>If possible, avoid charging for value that users previously received for free<li>Avoid reducing access to value that users have become accustomed to receiving<li>Instead, when transitioning, strive to create new additional values that justifies the charge<li>Consider potential monetization strategies when making your initial platform design choice</ul></ul><h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3><ul><li>The right metrics depend on the stage the platform/company is in<li>Startup Phase:<ul><li>Liquidity: track % of listings that lead to interactions within a given time period<ul><li>Also track the occurrence of illiquid situations (eg when user books an Uber but no car is around)<li>This metric tracks user activity, and looks beyond just raw user growth</ul><li>Matching quality: accuracy of the search algo and the intuitiveness of the navigation tools → achieved through good product curation.<ul><li>Sales conversion rate: % of searches that lead to interactions. What’s the threshold? Correlate the interaction % with long-term rate of activity (eg if conversion is 40% correlates positively to users remaining active for 3 months). However, I don’t think this is a foolproof rule.</ul><li>Trust: users feel comfortable with the level of risk associated with engaging in interactions in the platform.</ul><li>Growth Phase:<ul><li>producer-to-consumer ratio (adjust for only active users): monitor balance on both sides<li>Producer side: freq of producer participation, listings created, outcomes achieved, interaction failure, producer fraud, churn<li>Consumer side: freq of consumption, searches, rate of conversion to sale, also churn<li>interaction conversion rate is of course still important<li>side switching rate (in the case of Airbnb, guests who become hosts)</ul><li>Maturity Phase:<ul><li>drive innovation and facilitate resource allocation</ul></ul><h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3><ul><li>“The shift from protecting value inside the firm to create value outside the firm means that the crucial factor is no longer ownership but opportunity, while the chief tool is no longer dictation but persuasion.”<li>Multihoming: when users engage in similar types of of interactions on more than one platform (eg I’m on both Grab and Foodpanda) → platforms seek to discourage this since it increases the risk of user preferring one over the other.<li>3D competition: platform vs platform, platform vs partner, partner vs partner</ul></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/book-notes/'>book-notes</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/business/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >business</a> <a href="/tags/tech/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >tech</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Platform Revolution by Geoffrey Parker, Marshall Van Alstyne & Sangeet Paul Choudary -
