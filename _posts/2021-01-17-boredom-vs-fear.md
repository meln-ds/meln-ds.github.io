## What I’ve been thinking about

Just a thought. I was on my usual cycle to the park, when I thought about fear. We’re fearful of a lot of things, but our fears change as we get older. When I was a child, I was afraid of many things – snakes, spiders, cockroaches, and most importantly ghosts. I was so afraid of ghosts there was one time I could not sleep for nights on end after accidentally opening a jump scare.

Am I still afraid of ghosts today? Yes, but to a much less extent. Today, the things that I am afraid of are laughably trivial from the perspective of a kid. I’m afraid of losing my job. I’m afraid of making a conversation with someone new. I’m afraid of rejections. I’m afraid of the structure of my life being turned upside down.

Today, on my bike ride, I thought about **why** I’m so afraid. If I actually lose my job today, I can fly back home, take a barista course, serve coffee. If I can’t stay in Singapore, then I will go back to Vietnam. Would I be completely jobless for the rest of my life? Nope. Would I not have a place to stay? Nope. If I get rejected (and I have been getting rejected for various things in life), my life goes on. Yeah I’m sad for a while, but life goes on. My life doesn’t crumble apart. And come to think of it, how many of us are stuck in a boring job, yet we are so afraid of losing it? We know full well that the world doesn’t end if we uproot, and yet, it’s so hella daunting that some of us got stuck forever, or worse, plunged ourselves into darkness.

The truth is, I think, is we are inherently creatures of habits, and we are afraid of changes. If we let changes get the better of us, and refuse to practice embracing change, we will wind up choosing fear over boredom, even if we could rationalize the fear, or know full well that the actual outcome is oftentimes never as bad as the images that we conjure to ourselves.

I personally consider myself to be lucky just to be alive – the pandemic has taken 2 million lives. 2 million people have died, yes. But whatever the circumstances are, never stop practicing change. It might be the end for us tomorrow, but it also might not. Probably not. Be a creature of a habit still, but also let your relentless survival instincts thrive (disclaimer: don’t start doing bad things, kid. Embrace change, but keep your common sense).

## Video of the Week

I finished watching [“Don’t F*ck With Cats”](https://youtu.be/x41SMm-9-i4). The series was dark (obviously – it was about catching a killer), disturbing, and really thrilling. Admittedly, it takes a crazy (and brilliant) mind like the killer to commit something so horrific yet so unbelievable it was almost cinematic.
