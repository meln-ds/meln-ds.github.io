## What I’ve been thinking about

This week I had a conversation that unraveled some disturbing events in the past one year. While I was fully aware that what happened in the past should stay in the past and that present and future actions are what actually matters, it was still an uncomfortable situation.

When we come across things or people that do not necessarily align with our moral values and principles, how do we deal with them? On the one hand, we have to ensure our mind is able to clearly discern what is within our control and should be managed, but on the other hand, there is an allure in trying to obtain as much information as possible and analyze them. I’m trying to write this in a generalized sense but the actual issue is probably much simpler – we struggle to move on from the past, and the million dollar question would be, how likely do we think what happened in the past would repeat itself from the future and decide whether to walk away or continue?

I would think more on this topic but my initial thought is none of us can predict the future with 100% accuracy, nor can we have a risk-free life. Trying to predict the future is like trying to predict whether the stock market is going up or down say 10 days from now. We operate in constantly changing environment with countless moving pieces and we have to realize that it’s impossible to assign a statistically accurate figure (hey, that’s why humans invented confidence interval). So before we even attempt to answer the question, it’s important to keep that in mind.  

That being said, it is possible to make an informed decision and this is as curious cats as we ever are our brains are primed to gather and analyze huge chunks of information. We use the past as an indicator, we try to collect data as much as possible, we try to connect the dots and they together could lead to revelations that hopefully allows us to decide within our reasonable means what is the next course of action.

All of this is great in pure logical sense, but recall that we are also highly irrational beings. When it comes to emotions, our brains do not think as straight as we expect they would be. We walk into things we know full well are high risk and we do them anyway. We know a person is bad based on past events but we may still stick with them anyway. If we could all take a step back and look at our behaviors from a glass panel it would be fascinating to see how just magnificently complex we are.

Coming back to the question laid out at the start, did I ever find an answer? Did I ever reconcile with the past? Not entirely. I don’t think it is an easy feat – on the contrary, it is quite easy to watch my mind come to terms with it. Regardless, I will attempt to answer:
- We don’t know. The most sensible way is to make a decision, but not get too hung up on it, because things aren’t meant to stay constant. New information could arrive and alter the next decision we make.
- Keep an open mind. Rather than investing all your time and effort in finding the golden answer, understand that we inherently live in a world full of unknowns. By embracing the uncertainty while keeping our mind open for the next thing to come, we remove the cap to our life’s potential.
- The past is sometimes just not reconcilable and that could get into your set of moral compass. We don’t control our options, but hopefully, the freedom of choice is still with us. If you truly think it adds value to our present and future addressing the past, definitely do so. If you don’t think it does, change the narrative and channel our energy to something better.

## Video of the Week

Between the Grey’s Anatomy binge and OverSimplified binge, both giving me great joy, I watched a [video](https://youtu.be/JMLsHI8aV0g) this week about how schools in China are using EEG + AI technologies to monitor students in real time. Teachers can see, in 10-minute intervals, which students are slacking and which are focusing. Stats are aggregated and fed back as training data to the algorithm and also to a parents’ group chat. Arguably this raises serious ethical questions not only in terms of data privacy, but also social pressure and unprecedented impact. 1984 re-enactment ? Quite close.

## Quote of the week

I want to dedicate this week to Abraham Lincoln, a great man. He didn’t make all the right decisions during the American Civil War, but it was his perseverance and relentlessness that united the country and ended slavery, something even the founding fathers of America could not do.

>“I am a slow walker, but I never walk back.”
*Abraham Lincoln*

Charge in, guns blazing!
