Over lunch with some of the senior management in my company today, someone asked:

“Do you know who’s my idol?”

Everyone shook their heads. Thoughts started running through my mind. My first instinct is to think of successful business people in the financial services world. Rich people. High ranking corporate people. Famous people.

Before I had a chance to make a guess, he answered.

> “Myself in 10 years.”

That was when I paused my train of thoughts and questioned myself. Who is my idol? I surely have many and they range from superheroes to famous figureheads to successful people around me. Why are they my idol? They have something – a quality, a characteristic, something about them that I desire, something about them that I want to acquire for myself.

I wasn’t expecting this answer. He then explained that he had a process of visualizing himself and where he would be in the next decade, and then set out to work to become that person. He also started with qualities or things he desires, but instead of pinning them on someone externally, he pinned them on himself.

There are fundamentally two great reasons why our future self should be our idol. One, it gives us a chance to really think about the things we want to achieve in our lives. Do we actually desire fame? Can we truly picture ourselves with fame, or do we simply enjoy seeing famous people? The thought exercise eventually helps us not just understand ourselves but actually what we want our identities to be.

Making our future self our own idol also means setting much more realistic, closer-to-home, relatable goals, because guess what, this is the future self we’re talking about. We’re not just using an avatar. We’re using ourselves, with the qualities that we have cherry-picked, and no one else but ourselves are going to put in the work to get to that future. By changing our mindset, we immediately elevate the importance of ourselves, and sure enough, how much we think we should be invested in ourselves.

So how to we ensure that we don’t lose track of who we want to be in 10 years? Keep writing about ourselves. My colleague updates his resume on a regular basis, not because he’s looking for a job, but so that he does not lose track of his progress.

However, setting our future self as the goal means we’re always chasing a better version of ourselves, and while this is a great way to motivate ourselves to improve, it can cause an adverse effect if we get caught up in a quest to get to the “top” using whichever means possible. Again, the mindset should be – strive to be a better version of yourself, but at the same time, be kind and honest to yourself. Remember that we’re human and we beyond all else should embrace and love ourselves first, before attempting to set new heights. If you don’t like who you are, set your future self to be who you think you want to be. But don’t kick the moral bucket list, and don’t hate yourself more (read: unrealistic expectations) when you think you’re falling behind. Designing a race to future self can be fun and motivational and challenging, as long as it is designed, thought through, and handled with care.
