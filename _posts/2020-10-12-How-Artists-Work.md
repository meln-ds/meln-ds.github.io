I will begin by saying that this is a really straightforward book and by publishing a summary I am practically at risk of publishing the entire content of the book. So I will just leave a few quick notes here.

This book is a magnificent repository of how artists work on a day to day basis. Artists here refers to not only painters, but writers, scientists, composers, designers, and so one. And this book isn’t going to tell you how a certain artist came up with a certain masterpiece – in fact, it is a lot simpler than that. The book is about their daily routines – waking up, eating, working, walking, reading, and all the quirky stuffs they did during the day.

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

## How the Book Changed Me

- It has changed my perspective on how I view creative work. I often (yes I’m guilty) think of creative work as something that’s highly random. To a certain extent, yes, there were many artists who functioned based on bursts of inspiration. But there were also so, so many artists who thought of their work the same way I think of my work, and in that sense, it has also shifted my mindset about daily routines being something more for the highly organized people who would be more likely to engage in non-creative work.
- It has also emphasized the value of hard work. Of course, there is an element of talent, luck, passion, timing, but for the most part, it is all about hard work and patience. Most of the featured artists were absolutely hard-working when it comes to their lifelong calling and even those who dreaded working managed to put in work one way or the other.

## My Top Quotes

While the book detailed the lives of both artists who were really disciplined about their routines vs those who were not, I particularly liked the following remarks about having a daily routine –

> “The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.”

And another one:

> “Be regular and orderly in your life like a Bourgeois so that you may be violent and original in your work.”

## Interesting Facts

Since this book is biographical in nature I shall not attempt to summarize the entire book (that would be a complete copyright infringement). Instead, I shall record interest passages that I came across. Disclaimer: these are my personal favorites and in no way did I mean to compare the ‘interestingness’ of daily rituals between one artist to the other. I hope though that if you pick up this book, you will handpick your own favorite snippets as well.

On **Patricia Highsmith**, totally unrelated to daily rituals but she had 300 snails as pets. When she moved to France she had to get around the prohibition to bring snails into the country by making several round trips between her old house in London and France, each time carrying 6-10 snails hidden under each breast (just a fun fact :)).

**Gustav Mahler** had a rather interesting daily routine. He woke up and walked to a hut to work, and the cook must take another path to so as to not bump into him when bringing him coffee. He also demanded complete silence; his wife was not allowed to play the piano and had to bribe the neighbors to keep their dogs locked up. Mahler was also a rather distant chap. More interestingly, and again unrelated, his wife was also a promising composer but was made to quit by no other than Mahler himself. Such a sacrifice!

**William James** remarked, “Recollect that only when habits of order are formed can we advance to really interesting fields of action – and consequently accumulate grain on grain of wilful choice like a very miser-never forgetting how one link dropped undoes an indefinite number.” He however was a chronically indecisive guy and lived in a disorderly fashion. His words were more of a hard-earned lesson understood only with hindsight.

Again not on daily routines, but **Dmitry Shostakovich** could conceptualize a new work entirely in his head and subsequently write down rapidly. He averaged 20-30 scores a day after spending hours and days composing mentally – now that’s what I call extreme levels of intelligence and memory!

**Friedrich Schiller** kept a drawer full of rotting apples in his workroom – he needed the decaying smell in order to feel the urge to write.

**Knut Hamsun** woke up after a couple of hours of sleep and wrote completely in the dark (he did not switch on any light). Surprisingly he had no problem deciphering his writing in the morning.

**Anne Rice** thought that to her it’s “not a matter of being strict”. She eased into a routine naturally and didn’t force herself to work. However, she cautioned that one must be strict about social engagements.

To summarize, this book is:

- A collection of daily rituals from artists – painters, composers, writers, scientists.
- Not all artists work in a random fashion as the stereotype goes. On the contrary, most people have daily routines that they adhere to, from mundane to highly peculiar.
- There is not one single routine that works for everyone. Instead, the daily routine is something that one needs to cultivate over time.
