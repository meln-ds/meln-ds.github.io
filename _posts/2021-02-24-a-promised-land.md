## 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences

A story, no, an epic saga of Barack Obama - the 44th President of the United States of America. A thrilling depiction of his journey, from a young boy born in Hawaii and grew up in Indonesia, to a young man devoted to his political career, to the captain steering the ship of the largest economy in the world. A fantastic, thrilling, almost unbelievable account of a guy who did not throw away his shot.

## 🎨 Impressions

It's a really long book, and I honestly have never before in my life tackled such a magnificent story about someone's life. I'm sure I will forget all the details shortly after I read (indeed I did), but there's one thing I will remember - Obama is, first of all, human, like all of us. He's not God or a superhero - he was a stubborn man refusing to give up, who had an equally amazing woman who supported and rose next to him. Sure, you can criticize Obama on many things. But as a President whose job is meant to solve problems that have never existed before, he has my respect.

And remember this - he survived his Presidency during the 2008 Financial Crisis.

## 🤓 Who Should Read It?

Anyone who's looking for inspiration, and every US citizen.

## ☘️ How the Book Changed Me

Here are some of the highlights in the book that I would suggest zooming into.

- Barack's journey to become an opinionated man (life before entering Harvard Law School)
- His difficult journey to first become a senator. His ability to remain calm in the middle of a storm
- His ability to work with uncertainties, dealing with large-scale, unknown problems
- His approach towards treating his political opponents
- His journey throughout the 2008 financial crisis

## ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes

- “I’ve often been asked about this personality trait—my ability to maintain composure in the middle of crisis. Sometimes I’ll say that it’s just a matter of temperament, or a consequence of being raised in Hawaii, since it’s hard to get stressed when it’s eighty degrees and sunny and you’re five minutes from the beach. If I’m talking to a group of young people, I’ll describe how over time I’ve trained myself to take the long view, about how important it is to stay focused on your goals rather than getting hung up on the daily ups and downs.”
- “Have you ever noticed that if there’s a hard way and an easy way, you choose the hard way every time? Why do you think that is?”
- “I experienced failure and learned to buck up so I could rally those who’d put their trust in me. I suffered rejections and insults often enough to stop fearing them. In other words, I grew up—and got my sense of humor back.”
- “Perhaps most troubling of all, our democracy seems to be teetering on the brink of crisis—a crisis rooted in a fundamental contest between two opposing visions of what America is and what it should be; a crisis that has left the body politic divided, angry, and mistrustful, and has allowed for an ongoing breach of institutional norms, procedural safeguards, and the adherence to basic facts that both Republicans and Democrats once took for granted.”
