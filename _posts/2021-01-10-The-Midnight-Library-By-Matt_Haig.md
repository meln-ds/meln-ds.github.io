Introducing my most favorite fiction book of 2020. The Midnight Library asks one single question – What would happen if we are allowed to live through all the possibilities that could have happened to our life?

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## ⛰ What It’s About

The story revolves around Nora, a woman who was at a low point she decided to commit suicide. Instead, she was brought to the midnight library, a library that only exists between life and death, and in here she could choose to experience all the possibilities that could have happened in her root life.

## 🔍 How I Discovered It

This book is the Goodreads 2020 Awards winner in the Fiction category.

## 🧠 Thoughts

I am at a low-point in life myself, so when I picked up this book, I was sucked into it. I remembered being so immersed in the book that one day when I walked out of the train station, it felt like I was living in a parallel life as Nora did. It felt like a dream for several seconds until I realized that I was not. That was when I know that I am hooked.

### What I Liked About It
The Midnight Library uses the concept of parallel universe to illustrate one point – the only way to learn is to live, and that while it is so easy to think about the stuff that we could have had or we don’t have, it does not mean that our life is not worth living. It is the regret that makes us spiral down a staircase of despair. Nora had thought she could find an alternative life where she would be happy, but even when she thought she did, it was not right. Because she didn’t live that life. She got the results but did not go through the journey.

It took me so long so move on from Cherie because I thought I would regret letting her out of my life forever. There may exist a life where we are married. In this root life, we are not. I don’t get to experience a parallel life like Nora, but I know that someone who walked away the minute it gets difficult isn’t someone I should have serious feelings for.

> Because, Nora, sometimes the only way to learn is to live.  

### What I Didn’t Like About It

Nothing, honestly.

## 🥰 Who Would Like It?

Everyone.
