## What I’ve been thinking about

I spent a lot of time this week stalking Facebook accounts. I’m not going to lie – it felt good. It made me feel like I have a distinct advantage. I have knowledge, and knowledge translates to control. Until I woke up one day and realize two things – one, I have done this before, and that happiness was really short-lived. I did not feel any happier with the discovery, at least not too long. Instead two happened, which was when my mind spiralled down into an uncontrollable obsession where I found myself checking every few times a day. In the end, I think it is good to be informed, but I have gone too far and fallen into the illusion of control.

The illusion of control is a cognitive bias first discovered by Ellen Langer in the 1970. Through knowledge, understanding and other reasons, people often believe that they have control over events in their lives, even when such control is impossible. Experiments showed that people think they have control in outcomes even though in reality they don’t, such as in a lottery or gambling experiment where participants believe that if they choose the numbers themselves there is a higher chance of them winning.

When we hold on tightly to what we think is control, we are paying a direct trade-off to flexibility. Things have to be just so. A is right, and B is not. Worse, we start to think we could control external factors or other individuals, and when things do not turn out to be the way we imagine, control instead has a grip on us. Unsurprisingly, the illusion of control could lead to anger, frustration, self-hate, and a myriad of other negative feelings. We blame ourselves for the things we actually have no control of and somehow make ourselves responsible and punishable to the outcome.

I met my mentor on a crisp, sunny Friday afternoon and this is possibly the point where I realize that I need to learn to let go. There were obviously things happening in the past that I have attributed to myself as the ultimate culprit. There was a lot of hatred and criticism on myself. But at the end of the day, I understand that my sphere of influence isn’t only finite, it is really small. And if there is something that I have zero control over, it would be my past. By refusing to let go and subjecting myself to more and more self-blame I have unconsciously placed a lower cap on my potential to enjoy life and channeled my energy to things that matter more.

So if you’re like me and are finding yourself beating over some bad situations that happen in the past, or are unhappy at the moment about your life and relationships, I encourage you to take a hard look at everything around you and ask yourself a question – Do I really have control over this? What are the options that I have? Remember – we each have access to a different set of options, but we always have the power of choice. Once you have done this mental exercise, let yourself breathe a little. There will still be black and white things in this world, but there is also a giant patch of the rainbow where each and every aspect of our lives is ever-changing and iterating. Be more flexible, and you’d be surprised how much more relieved you have given yourself.

I enjoyed watching the history of [King Henry VII of England](https://youtu.be/ewLpXw6uN28) and how his life unfolded. OverSimplified has a great sense of humour, adorable illustration, and really well content put together.
