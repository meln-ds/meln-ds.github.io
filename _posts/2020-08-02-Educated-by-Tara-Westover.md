I will be honest – I have put off reading Educated for a long time. It popped up not long after I finished reading Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz where he discussed the dark sides of the ‘elite’ American education and how the system is designed to produce people gravitating towards ‘safe’ paths with good career prospects but little sense of purpose.

So needless to say, seeing the word Educated immediately made my brain categorize both books into the same basket. In retrospect, they both touch on the subject of education, and Tara was born and grew up in the US, but each book uses a completely different lens. Tara was telling a story, and I was set to read hers.

Four days later, I set the book down, heavy with thoughts.

Tara’s book isn’t so much about the education system. It wasn’t about whether it was effective on her, and as a whole or not. Nor was it just about her breaking the shambles and going to school.

It was a battle, and through that battle, the meaning of the word education shines.

There are plenty of reviews that would discuss Tara’s personal journey, her struggles and traumas coming to terms with herself and the relationship she has with her upbringing, and I would think that if anybody thinks it makes no sense why she struggled so much believing in herself and her memories while she was enrolled in two of the most prestigious institutions of the world, think again. And this was one of the point where I see Tara and William’s writings come together though still being in two completely different genres – the brand name of the school does little to the process of education. This comes with a caveat – what exactly is education? Both writers agree; education is much less about which Ivy league one is enrolled to and which career path would one end up with, it is rather a process of self-discovery, or in William’s words, “nothing less than our ability to remain fully human.”.

> “What’s the return on investment of college? What’s the return on investment of having children, spending time with friends, listening to music, reading a book? The things that are most worth doing are worth doing for their own sake. Anyone who tells you that the sole purpose of education is the acquisition of negotiable skills is attempting to reduce you to a productive employee at work, a gullible consumer in the market, and a docile subject of the state. What’s at stake, when we ask what college is for, is nothing less than our ability to remain fully human.”
*William Deresiewicz*

That was just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout the book, I was angry several times. The things her father said, her brother Shawn did, her mother lied to her about – I was at a loss, struggling to comprehend their thought process. But I realized that they are guided by their religion, their faith, and never before have I see the actual power of human faith and how it can be used to bend, twist, shape, or even distort reality. Tara’s journey was even more complex because she was barely exposed to the world outside of Buck’s Peak, and for years live under one single doctrine – her father is the truth.

Even after Tara had partially shifted away from her family, it is undeniable that her worldview has been shaped completely by her dad, and throughout the process of Tara moving from BYU to Cambridge and to Harvard, you would see that she’s never completely out of it.

But she fought, and her battle was truly a sign of bravery and perseverance. It was as though Tara held my hand and guided me along her journey. From her not knowing what ‘Holocaust’ meant, to her finding out the meaning of the word ‘Nigger’, to questioning how historians, the ‘gatekeepers’, reconcile their world views, their collection of stories, to dissecting the Federalist papers and comparing to 18th-century philosophy, to writing about freedom. Each step Tara took was an amazing showcase of the progress she has made and how she slowly evolved and grew. I felt every bit of it even though the majority of the book had revolved around Buck’s Peak instead. She knew it was okay, to not know the unknown, and to a certain extent, to be vulnerable to uncertainty.

> "To admit uncertainty is to admit to weakness, to powerlessness, and to believe in yourself despite both. It is a frailty, but in this frailty there is a strength: the conviction to live in your own mind, and not in someone else’s."
*Tara Westover*

If I have to pick a single gem for myself, I’d pick chapter 28, Pygmalion. Tara’s first few days in Cambridge, her meeting with Professor Steinberg, and this – this paragraph blew my mind, not because it was shocking or surprising, but a distillation of the most important aspect of education.

> "From my father I had learned that books were to be either adored or exiled.[…] I had been taught to read the words of men like Madison as a cast into which I ought to pour the plaster of my own mind, to be reshaped according to the contours of their faultless model. I read them to learn what to think, now how to think for myself. […]
To write my essay I had to read books differently, without giving myself over to either fear or adoration. Because Burke had defended the British monarchy, Dad would have said he was an agent of tyranny. […] There was a thrill in trusting myself to read the words. I felt a similar thrill in reading Madison, Hamilton and Jay, especially on those occasions when I discarded their conclusions in favor of Burke’s, or when it seemed to me that their ideas were not really different in substance, only in form. […] that books are not tricks, and that I was not feeble."

By the time I finished part 2, there was hope. There was a part in me hoping that Tara could come back and set the records straight and somehow clear the fog shrouding her family’s minds. It was sad to see what unfolded in the following chapters, and once again, when your father is considered the golden source of truth, his power in the family is immense, and Tara found herself threatened to be killed with no means to protect herself, even if she was an ocean away. It pained me to see her gasping for justice, for morality, heck, for logic, only to be dragged into a nightmarish episode her father, mother, and brother Shawn constructed, determined to destroy her.

Again she fought.

> "Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create. If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of my own mind. This was the price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now. What my father wanted to cast away from me wasn’t a demon: it was me."
*Tara Westover*

(and no, she did not accept her father’s blessing).

It is sad to see her eventually having to part ways completely from certain members of the family, which surely isn’t easy. But she emerged triumphant at the end. She lost the people who grew her and taught her to be strong, to stay grounded regardless of whether the wind is in the air or on the ground, to be independent – fiercely independent, but found herself. And just like a reader presented with numerous world views, the process of reconciliation has completed, and the reader has reached that point in the discovery journey where he/she ends up with a view he/she can comfortably settle in, and together with that a sense of self and the ability to think. That, is what an education is all about.
