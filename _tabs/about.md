Hi there, I'm Mel (she/her), and welcome to my humble abode.

## What I Do (Mostly)

⌨️ I am a [Product Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melnguyen16/) based in Singapore. I speak to users and try to read their minds, have intellectual debates with developers, dig for bugs with QA, and overall is a software requirements geek.  
💻I currently am pursuing a Master’s Degree in Applied Data Science, where I try to develop a data-driven mindset, build technical skills, and tinker with the magnificent world of AI/ML. Occasionally I write (hopefully) useful code snippets or share my data science projects onto [Github](https://github.com/meln-ds).  
✏️ Despite being awfully mediocre in writing during my student days, I've always found writing to be not only a great soundboard to my thoughts and emotions, but also a way for me to record invaluable wisdom from books I read, conversations I have, places I go, and thoughts I muster up during my night showers or evening cycling.

## Other Stuffs

🤓I am a constant learner. The most memorable experience was back in 2019, when I completed a whole 6 courses of Python in 2 weeks because I never thought I'd one day get a conditional offer to study Data Science. Since then, I've valued the experience of self-taught learning a lot more, and know that with enough effort and curiosity, knowledge is never truly out of reach.
🇻🇳I was born in and will forever call Saigon my home. Have you ever tried slurping a bowl of phở in the middle of Saigon's ridiculous traffic? Trust me, it’s freaking awesome.
🛫I love travelling to new lands and drinking coffee. In short, I like drinking coffee in as many different landscapes as possible. Most memorable one? An instant coffee at 2 am in the morning at 2800m above sea level, prior to our ascend to [Mt. Fansipan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansipan)
