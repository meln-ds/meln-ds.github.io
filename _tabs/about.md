Hi there, my name is Mel (she/her), and this is a peek into my world on the Internet 👩‍💻

## What I Do (Mostly)

⌨️ I am a [Product Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melnguyen16/) based in Singapore. I speak to users and try to read their minds, have intellectual debates with developers, dig for bugs with QA, and overall is a software requirements geek.  
💻 I currently am pursuing a Master’s Degree in Applied Data Science, where I try to develop a data-driven mindset, build technical skills, and tinker with the magnificent world of AI/ML. Occasionally I write (hopefully) useful code snippets or share my data science projects onto [Github](https://github.com/meln-ds).  
✏️ On this website, I write about inspirational people, books, data, and life wisdom that I distill over the years.

## Other Stuffs

🤓I am a constant learner. Besides Python and ML which I need for my Master’s degree, I teach myself Tableau, Figma, German, and the list can easily go on.  
🇻🇳I was born in and will forever call Saigon my home. Have you ever tried slurping a bowl of phở in the middle of Saigonese’s ridiculous traffic? Trust me, it’s freaking awesome.

## Get In Touch

I'm best reachable via [email](mel.nguyen273@gmail.com).
